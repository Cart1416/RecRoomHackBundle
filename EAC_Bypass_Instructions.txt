hi so this eac bypass does not blue screen because patchguard can't pick it up hope you like it


1, first open up Wind64 and follow the steps to install it


2, launch cheat engine make sure scan/memory is on in edit > settings it should say dbk64 loaded


3, now re open wind64 and uninstall it should give you the option


4, now open rec room if you get an error repeat the steps leading up to this


5, once you load into your dorm open ce scan enable script and copy it


6, now go to cheat engine and click on table then ce lua script and paste


7, rec room scan should be enabled now it will just be ?? as the value
